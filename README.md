## Description

The auth microservice, developed using Nest.js, focuses on managing session authentication for user memberships within the platform. It handles user authentication, token generation using JWT after membership validation, and session management.

On the other hand, profile management operations are handled within the user microservice. The user microservice, also developed using Nest.js, manages user profiles and other membership-related functionalities.

This microservice communicates with the api-gateway and other services via GRPC. 

## Backend Technologies

- **Nest.js:** Employed for developing the microservice architecture.
- **gRPC:** Used for communication between microservices.
- **i18next:** Used for internationalization (i18n) support.
- **class-validator:** Used for validation within Nest.js.
- **class-transformer:** Used for object transformation within Nest.js.
- **JWT:** Utilized for session authentication and token generation.

## Installing

Note: Please don't forget to use this service with api-gateway and question and auth microservices.

First setup the env file. You must generate a JWT Secret key. If nessesery change the user service URL. 

```env
NODE_ENV=development

JWT_SECRET=

USER_SERVICE=0.0.0.0:5002
